     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>
       I am a third year Psychological Science major at Illinois Institute of
       Technology. I was recruited by the head coach of the women's soccer team
       to play and continue my education. I am originally from San Diego county
       in California. I grew up in a town called Encinitas and within that a
       community called Leucadia. It's a beautiful coastal town that has a lot
       of sunshine, beaches, and tourist. The reason I came all the way out to
       Chicago was to experience diversity and to begin my journey through life
       in a new fantastic city where I could get the most out of my college
       years. By that I mean learn to do things on my own, meet new people, and
       simply discover who I want to be and what I want to do. It was
       definitely a drastic change moving to the midwest but at the same time
       its been an adventure. My first winter ive ever experienced was a polar
       vortex! its was scary at the time but now just a crazy memory of my first
       actual winter in Chicago. Not many people where im from can say that.
       Ive been so happy here for the last three years and cant wait to keep my
       journey going.

     <h3>About my family</h3>
     <p>
       I have a very supportive family, my dad Noren is my number one fan when
       it comes to soccer and life in general. He's the one that pushed me to
       venture out of California for school beacuse he knew it would be best for
       me. My mom Lisa lives in Humboldt County which is very nothern
       California and she is a beautiful and adventurous woman who im convinced
       has absolutely no fears. She picked up her life and moved completely off
       the grid and is now building her own cabin on her property out in the red
       woods. My older sister Rachel just graduated from Humboldt State and is
       now living in the area just enjoying life and looking for jobs. Shes a
       wonderfully talented artist who has always been a great role model for
       me.
